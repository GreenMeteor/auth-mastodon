# Mastodon Sign-In

Using this module, users can directly log in or register with their selected Mastodon site's credentials within their HumHub installation. 

A new button "Mastodon" will appear on the login page.

## Configuration

Please follow the [Mastodon instructions](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/oauth/) to create the required ` OAuth client ID` credentials.

Once you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** created there, the values must then be entered in the module configuration at: `Administration -> Modules -> Mastodon -> Settings`. 
This page also displays the `Authorized redirect URI`, which must be inserted in the selected Mastodon website's corresponding field.
